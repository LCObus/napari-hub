# napari hub

This repository contains source code for the _napari hub_, the place to find, evaluate, and install _napari_ plugins.

The Imaging team at CZI seeks to give biologists access to next-generation analysis tools by establishing napari & its nascent ecosystem of plugins as a next-generation platform for bioimage analysis. However, to ensure that Research Biologists can rely on napari and its plugin ecosystem for quality reproducible science, they need to be able to find and install these plugins into their local napari environment.

Currently, napari plugins are distributed through Pypi, however this interface poses challenges for end users seeking to find plugins which are relevant to their needs.

High Level Approach
The CZI Imaging Team will build and manage the napari hub, to enable discovery and installation of napari plugins. For the first release, this will be a public web app which displays napari plugins that have been shared on PyPI.org, but focused on the needs of Research Biologists, Imaging Scientists, and Bioimage Analysts.


## what we're building



## about

The _napari hub_ is a service of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. 
napari is a consensus-based community project and an open source tool that enables high performance visualization and exploration of a broad range of imaging data, including microscopy, medical imaging, geospatial data, and more, with clearly defined governance model, mission, and values. 
At CZI, we support the development of open source and community run tools like napari, as part of our mission to accelerate biomedical research and help every scientist make progress faster. 
The CZI Imaging Team seeks to remove barriers in the analysis of imaging and microscopy data and make it easier for biologists to access emerging methods for bioimage analysis that leverage machine learning. 
CZI sees promise in napari and seeks to assist its development by providing resources not always available to the open source community, including dedicated user research, design, and engineering support. 
CZI is proud to collaborate with the science community to accelerate research and enable open science for all.
