# napari hub

This repository contains the source code for the _napari hub_, a place to find, evaluate, and install _napari_ plugins, build by the Imaging team at the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

## What we're building now

For our first _alpha/v0_ release in June 2021, the _napari hub_ will focus on making it easy for [Research Biologists, Imaging Scientists, and Bioimage Analysts](https://cziscience.medium.com/user-experience-research-in-the-imaging-field-6bb89e592bb9) to find, evaluate, and install _napari_ plugins distributed through PyPI.

Through talking with users about challenges and needs finding analysis solutions of bioimaging problems, we focused on a handful of critical features for our first release, including...

- *Global Search Bar* which returns results from multiple metadata sources (title, author, summary, description, etc)
- *napari-specific metadata*, such as author(s), links to external docs, support channels, etc, that plugin developers can easily define in PyPI metadata or Github config files
- *napari-specific description* Must have: supports both napari-specific readme or default to regular readme if plugin developer does not use template, ability to pull from developer’s manual input readme in github to populate individual plugin page in discovery site.
- *Install “Call To Action”* button for each plugin with plugin-specific instructions on how to install
- *Filter/Sort* available plugins based on limited selection of metadata (2-3 filters, 1-2 sorts) that can be handled client side
- *Mailing List* sign up for announcements and updates for the _napari hub_


## About

The _napari hub_ is a service of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.

_napari_ is a consensus-based community project and an open source tool that enables high performance visualization and exploration of a broad range of imaging data, including microscopy, medical imaging, geospatial data, and more, with clearly defined governance model, mission, and values.
At CZI, we support the development of open source and community run tools like _napari_, as part of our mission to accelerate biomedical research and help every scientist make progress faster.

The CZI Imaging Team seeks to remove barriers in the analysis of imaging and microscopy data and make it easier for biologists to access emerging methods for bioimage analysis that leverage machine learning.
CZI sees promise in _napari_ and seeks to assist its development by providing resources not always available to the open source community, including dedicated user research, design, and engineering support.
CZI is proud to collaborate with the science community to accelerate research and enable open science for all.
